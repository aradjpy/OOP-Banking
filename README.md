# OOP-Banking
This is a simple Banking system aimed to introduce the design of an ATM, and specially Object Oriented Programming in python. 
If this and the previous projects (To do list, Income vs Donation regression) get an overall of more than 20 stars I will make an interactive fully complex banking system that follows your spending habits and gives financial advise based off of its financial data and predictions of the market totally interactive.
and like always "the entirety of this project was coded authentically, without the use of AI. While this is a kind of basic project, it—along with the ones that will follow—serves a larger purpose: rebuilding critical thinking skills rather than relying on having all the answers immediately available.

Some upcoming projects may involve Machine Learning or even Computer Vision, but the goal remains the same: completing everything without a single line of code written by AI. (Note: this text was grammatically refined by AI, so this is not meant as criticism or a promotion against using AI.)"
